I love weather... and Yoshi. The end.

<h2>Sadly since I am moving, My weather station data will not be sending reports. It will probably start sending data again sometime in July.</h2>

<h2>My best SC Flap is a 5"26 in Frappe Snowland. (MK64)</h2>

I luv Yoshi!!!

Still learning the basics of coding. My dream, to be meteoroligist someday.
