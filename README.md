Hi! My name is Jesse. I am a very VERY young user on github. I have had my intrest in Weather since I was 6 years old. I play Mario Kart 64, but I haven't set any new records since July 2023. I hope to get back to that someday. 

Coding since May 22 2023.

<h3>I have not been setting any new Mario Kart Records in a while, becuase I am currently writing Python and PHP and JavaScript. I will hopefully get back to that someday.</h3>

I luv Yoshi!!!

Still learning the basics of coding. My dream, to be meteoroligist someday.
